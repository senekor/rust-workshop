# What I left out from the book

- Things that are easy to pick up along the way.\
  (counter example: turbo fish `::<>` is impossible to google)
- Topics you're unlikely to run into at the start of your Rust journey.\
  (smart pointers, interior mutability, dynamic dispatch,\
  concurrency (`Send`, `Sync`), `unsafe` Rust, macros...)

You should still read the book at your own pace if you're serious about learning Rust!

# Hint for Practice Session

```rust {all|3|6|all}
// a test that ensures an expected panic occurs
#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn expected_panic_occurs() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    v[10];
}
```
