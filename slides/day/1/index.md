<!--
Rust has the same performance ceiling as C/C++.
Inline assembly is possible

Rust is memory safe like most garbage collected languages.
Unlike most languages, it even prevents data-races in multi-threaded environments.

Beyond safety aspects, Rust has many features that help you ensure your program does what it's supposed to.
- no null-pointers
- no implicit type conversions
- algebraic data types

Rust has excellent productivity tooling:
- type inference
- automatic formatting
- great IDE support (via LSP)
- package manager

From bare-metal embedded to WebAssembly in the browser - Rust can comfortably run anywhere unlike any other language
