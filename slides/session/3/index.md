# Generics: Example

Find the largest element in a list of i32.

<v-click>

```rust {all|2|3-8|10|all}
fn largest(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

```

</v-click>

<!--

What if we want to find the largest element in a list of i32?
something like this:

1) get the first element
2) loop over the list, comparing the elements and
   storing the larger one
3) return the largest number

-->

---

# Generics: Example

Find the largest element in a list of char.

<v-click>

```rust {0-10|12-22|all} {lines:true}
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}


```

</v-click>

<!--

known under many different names

looks exacly the same, right?

-->

---

# Generics: Example

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T { ... }
```

<!--

Generics in rust use these <> (less then and greater then) symbols and to denote the "generic types"
-> looks like in java/ C++ with templates

Removing Duplication by Extracting

-->

---

# Generics: Example

```rust {1-10|all}
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

<!--

let's try it out

to simulate the actuall call I have added a main function too

as you see it has a list

Obviously given the error message visible, we know that it didn't work.

look at the error message


it tells us we need something called a "std::cmp::PartialOrd" trait, if
we add that code it will run as we expect

We will talk about traits and this error again in a few minutes,
remeber this error for now.

# Generics: in Struct and Impl

```rust
struct Pair<F, S> {
    f: F,
    s: S,
}

impl<F,S> Pair<F,S> {
    fn fst(&self) -> &F {
        &self.f
    }

    fn snd(&self) -> &S {
        &self.f
    }
}
```

<!--

a simple example of a struct of pairs of elements

# Generics: Option / Result

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T)
    None,
}

impl<T> Option<T> {
    ...
}

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}

impl<T, E> Result<T, E> {
    ...
}
```

<!--

you remeber the error handling portion from last time?
this is all the magic required to create those types

except for the compiler remending you that you need
to handle the cases.

# Traits: Defining A Traits

```rust

    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        3.14159 * self.radius * self.radius

Shared behaviour

let's do the traditional example of the Shapes

now how do we combine these?

    let rec = Rectangle { side: 42.0 };
    let cir = Circle { radius: 42.0 };

# Traits: In Vector

$\to$ Shared Behaviour!

```rust {4|all}
fn main() {
    let rec = Rectangle { side: 42.0 };
    let cir = Circle { radius: 42.0 };
    let list : Vec<Box<dyn Shape>> = vec![ Box::new(rec), Box::new(cir) ];
    do_something(&list);
}
```

<v-clicks>

- Box is a smart pointer $\Rightarrow$ Vec is using the generic size of a Box
  (so we are moving rec & cir onto the heap).
- Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn Shape&gt;&gt; $\Rightarrow$ is the generic declaration of the vec
- dyn Shape $\Rightarrow$ means that we are using a dynamic object of type Shape

remeber our previous example?

std::cmp:: is part of the preable so not needed here

std::cmp::PartialOrd

# Traits: Complex Bounds

If we need to have more then one trait for a function

```rust
fn largest<T: PartialOrd + Debug>(list: &[T]) {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    println!("{:?}", largest);
}
```

---

# Traits: Complex Bounds

```rust
fn some_function<T: PartialEq + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32;
```

Equal but easier to read.

```rust
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: PartialEq + Clone
    U: Clone + Debug
```

<!--

Traits bounds can become very complicated fast

Arguably at that point you might have to overthink your design.

-->

---

# Traits: Derivable

Usefull for simple behaviour

- Comparison traits: <Orange>Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd</Orange>.
- <Orange>Clone</Orange>, to create T from &T via a copy.
- <Orange>Copy</Orange>, to give a type 'copy semantics' instead of 'move semantics'.
- <Orange>Hash</Orange>, to compute a hash from &T.
- <Orange>Default</Orange>, to create an empty instance of a data type.
- <Orange>Debug</Orange>, to format a value using the {:?} formatter.

<!--
A few default traits that you see basically every day in rust.
-->

---

# Traits: Derive

```rust {1-6|8-12}
struct Rectangle {
    side: f64
}

pub trait Clone {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;
}

impl Clone for Rectangle {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self { side: self.side.clone() }
    }
}
```

<!--
We have seen PartialOrd, Clone and Debug

Now how do we use them?
Do we have to manually implement them?
-->

---

# Traits: Derive

```rust {1-6|8-12}
#[derive(Hash, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Clone, Copy)]
struct Rectangle {
    side: usize
}
```

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    side: usize,
}
#[automatically_derived]
impl ::core::clone::Clone for Rectangle {
    #[inline]
    fn clone(&self) -> Rectangle {
        let _: ::core::clone::AssertParamIsClone<usize>;
        *self
    }
}
#[automatically_derived]
impl ::core::marker::Copy for Rectangle {}
// cut for brevity (cut out about 60 more lines)
```

<!--
We can use this lovely feature to
automatically write the boilerplate code -- thank god

I checked out the ammount of code that we do not have to
write ourselves per struct
-->

---

# Traits: Drop

- Is automatically derived for you (you can manually implement).
- The function `drop` is always the last function called once the objects goes
  out of scope.
- Is usually used to automatically free up resources.

```rust
pub trait Drop {
    // Required method
    fn drop(&mut self);
}
```

<!--
The Drop trait only has one method: drop, which is called automatically when an
object goes out of scope. The main use of the Drop trait is to free the
resources that the implementor instance owns.
-->

---

# Lifetimes: What is it?

Remeber the scope of an object?

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    println!("r: {}", r);
}
```

# Lifetimes: The Borrow Checker

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           //  |       |
    }                     // -+       |
                          //          |
    println!("r: {}", r); //          |
}
```

A borrow my never life longer then the owner!

<!--

r has the lifetime 'a
x has the lifetime 'b


we see that the lifetime of 'b is shorter then 'a right?

that is one of the rules:
-> A borrow my never life longer then the owner!



ASK if this makes sense or if someone has questions here!!!!

<!--
Problem that we are having is that the compiler doesn't know
for how long the return &str will live.

Rust never assumes anylive times if possible


Explain named life time parameter + similarities to generics.
=> every lifetime is unique -> so in theory there are as many
versions of this function as lifetimes it is used with.
(there only is a single version in reality, but for the
concept of the borrow checker it is good enough.)

# Lifetime: Generics

struct Part<'buffer> {
    buffer: &'buffer [u8],
}

fn main() {
    let buf = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    let p1 = Part { buffer: &buf[1..] };
    let p2 = Part { buffer: &buf[3..] };

```

<!--
Part allows us to safely operate on any buffer of bytes

=> Part can be replaced as offten as you like as long as
the compiler can guarantee that 'buffer lives longer.

Additionally I wanted to show you that for a lifetime as
well as a generic you can use full words.
-->

---

# Lifetime: Static

Special lifetime with $\infty$ timespan (basically the whole duration of a program).

```rust
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
```

<!--
You might see suggestions to use the 'static lifetime in error messages. But
honestly at that point you should rethink what you are doing, as it is rarely
the correct call.

# Lifetimes: Generic Type + Trait Bound + Lifetimes

```rust {3|4-6|9|all}

# Closures

- Anonymous function that can capture their environment
- Basically function ptr and a prefilled struct it carries with itself.

```rust
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
```

```rust
struct Wrapper {
    callback: Box<dyn Fn(usize, usize) -> usize>,
}

```

---

# Closure: Traits

Special bounds (uses a bit of compiler magic for the trait syntax)

### FnOnce

Can be called <Orange>only once</Orange> and can be used a bound for all types of functions.

### FnMut

Can be called <Orange>more then once</Orange> and is <Orange>guaranteed to mutate</Orange> at least one captured
variable.

```rust
let mut x = 44;
let f  = |s: u32| { x += 2; s * x };
let b : Box<dyn FnMut(u32) -> u32> = Box::new(f);
```

### Fn

Can be called <Orange>more then once</Orange> and is <Orange>guaranteed not to mutate</Orange> any captured
variables.

```rust
let x = 44;
let f = |s: u32| { s * x };
```

<!--
Higher-Rank Trait Bounds (use a bit of compiler magic because of the syntax)
see https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html

It is rare that you will have to care about these three traits, but in case
where you need to store a callback function. It is good to know.

# Iterator

Allows to process a series of items

- Ranges (1..10) || (1..=10)
- Collections (Array, Vector, HashMap, Slices)
- Operation Chaining

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    // required
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;

    // methods with default implementations elided
}
```

<!--
I don't plan on explaining the type Item here.
But in essence it allows to abstract over a generic
return type Self::Item.

# Iterators: Magic
