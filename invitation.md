# Rust Workshop Invitation

Hi there!
So you are considering to participate in the Rust workshop?
Great!

Read the following carefully to make sure the workshop is a success for you.

## Prerequisites

This workshop requires that you have basic programming skills.
Further, it expects you to know the basics of manual memory management.
Rust has an innovative approach to memory management, so knowledge of the prior art is required.
If the words "stack", "heap", "malloc" and "free" ring a bell, you're golden!

## Time investment

The workshop consists of a four-hour session every week for six weeks.
The sessions will be a mix of theory and practice, depending on what makes sense for the content.
It's mostly fifty-fifty.

There will be a flexible amount of homework each week, depending on how much time you can and want to invest.
1. You are expected to finish any exercises that were part of the session but couldn't be completed in time.
1. You are highly encouraged to do a small amount of homework to strengthen what was learned.
1. For those who want to get the most out of the workshop, there will be more time-consuming bonus exercises.

Expect to spend an additional two hours per week on homework.

## What to expect

- You will get an overview of what the language has to offer and how to find all the information you need to be productive in it.
- You will get hands-on experience with all of the core language features solving purpose-built exercises.
- You will spend enough time with Rust's standout features to understand and experience how they uniquely empower you to write great software.
- You will learn how to find, evaluate and use libraries to get things done quickly.
- You will learn about CI/CD tools to kickstart your next Rust project using state-of-the-art engineering practices.

Finally, employing everything you've learned, you will write a production-ready piece of software from scratch, like a CLI tool or web service.

## What to prepare

Just make sure to bring a laptop!
Any OS should work fine.

I hope to see you at the workshop! ðŸ˜ƒ
