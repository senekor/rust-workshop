# Where to Go Next

Most components don't have any requirements, so just pick one from the sidebar that interests you the most.
The few ones that do have requirements will say so at the beginning.

Note that for clients to be connected, some kind of server is required.
However, there is a reference implementation with API documentation hosted at [paekli.buenzli.dev](https://paekli.buenzli.dev).
Using that, you can connect all your clients without having to write a server yourself.
Thank you for being gentle to my server! ðŸ˜Š

If you are not the decisive kind, here's a little inspiration to help pick your next component:

- The [HTTP server](../http.md) is fun and quite simple.
  It has a good contrast to the CLI and it's always great to see through all layers of the stack.
- I have a web development background, so I am particularly fond of the [web app](../web_app.md).
  It's portable, easy to deploy and doesn't use a single line of JavaScript ðŸ˜Ž
- Another goal that might be worth working towards:
  Once you have a WebSocket-server and a GUI-client, you can make the GUI live-updating! ðŸ¤¯
