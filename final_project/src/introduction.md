# The Final Project

You now have all the individual skills necessary to create useful software.
You can write Rust code, use libraries, write tests and **continuously deliver** your product.
Now is the time to put everything together and ship a fully-featured application!

## The Topic

We humans learn best when we're having fun, so the application will be themed as a simulation of a postal service.
In practice, that's just a messaging application.
The reason this topic was chosen is because its feature set is very flexible and can adapt to what and how much **you** want to do.

Our postal service could be sending "packages" around, but that word has another meaning in the software world.
So, we'll be using the less ambiguous and more fun word âœ¨ **paekli** âœ¨ to refer to deliverables in our business domain.

## Components and Integrations

The whole project is structured around components and integrations.
In its simplest form, the application can be a single component, e.g. a CLI app, without any integrations.
If you choose to go the extra mile, the application can grow into a diverse set of networked clients and servers.

For example, a python script might call into a Rust library and send a paekli to an http server which live-updates a wasm-based browser app over websocket!
So cool! ðŸ¤©
